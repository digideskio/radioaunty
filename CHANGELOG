*2.0.1* (Oct 4th, 2010)

* Reverted to using the 1.2.1 lastFM Api
  The beta version I was using, is not ready for
  prime time just yet.
* A few bug fixes

*2.0.0* (Sept 23rd, 2010)

* Added BBC LiveText support
  In the application status bar, you will now see the same liveText that appears 
  on your DAB radio, and other places. This contains show, upcoming, and now 
  playing information. You can hide this via a toggle on the window. Please note, 
  you need direct access to the internet for this feature, as it will currently 
  not work through a proxy. In other words it's a bit experimental.
* Added LastFM scrobble support
  With the liveText support comes Now Playing information, so you can now choose 
  to auto-scrobble this. You can disable this when ever you need. Note, not 
  all Now Playing information is sent by the BBC, so the app cannot guarantee 
  that all tracks will be scrobbled.
* Removed Twitter support
  This may come back into the app at some point, but I stopped using Twitter 
  some time ago, and have no motivation to impliment the OAuth authentication 
  required to use their api currently.

*1.11* (March 26th, 2009)

* the schedule menu has been updated to
  correctly display what broadcast you are
  listening to, live or listen again. Also 
  if you are listening to a show again 
  the schedule will indicate this as well 
  as letting you see and select what is 
  currently playing live on that particular 
  network

*1.10* (March 25th, 2009)

* Fix memory leak
* A bit of code optimisation learnt
  from TellyBox
* Change player layout to very simple
  until something better comes along 
* Move BBC programmes libs to shared
  location away from the app and namespace. 
  They are now shared with TellyBox

*1.9* (March 13th, 2009)

* In a similar fashion to iTunes, you can 
  now minimize (Zoom) the Radio via 
  the Window menu or shortcut ^ CMD Z
  This only works for NON-RealPlayer streams
  The minimized version has resizable width
* Twitter support. Via the preferences menu
  You can now choose to post your listening 
  habits to the @radioandtvbot account 
  on twitter.com. You can optionally 
  provide your twitter username and 
  this will be in the tweet otherwise 
  your Mac login fullname will
  be used. There are growl notifications
  for this. The App will only tweet if you
  have been listening to the same show
  for over 5 mins
* The red close button now displayed. 
  It will quit the App
* The title in the window is now more
  useful, displaying what show you are 
  listening to. Especially useful when 
  the app is zoomed.
* The schedule stays up-to-date. This means
  that when the shows change and become 
  available to listen again, the app knows.
  It also means that the title and tweeting
  happens as you listen throughout the day.
* I've chopped out 20% of the codebase :)
  The more you read the documentation, the
  more you see how much Cocoa can do
* I've removed the extra preload window

*1.8* (Feb 12th, 2009)

* Now using high quality iPlayer Flash AAC streams 
  [http://bit.ly/Y1oac]

  NOTE!! If you want to use these new streams

  select High Quality from the list. The high
  quality streams are Uk only.
